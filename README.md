A plugin development helper comprised of the following functionalities:

Time Search API:

- `/timeindex/{time_value}/{since}/{to}` (builds Index for visually supporting time-queries)

Parameter `time_value` can be either `created` or `modified`.

Results of this API are each enriched about an icon path and their `created` and `modified` timestamps.

Topic query delivering a list of `SearchResult` (custom ViewModel):

- `/suggest/topics/{input}` (queries `Note Title`, `Topicmaps Name` and `Username`)
- `/suggest/topics/{input}/{typeUri}`

`Search Result` of this endpoint are each enriched about their `username` and `workspace` info.
